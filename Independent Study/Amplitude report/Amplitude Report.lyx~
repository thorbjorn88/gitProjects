\begin_layout Title
Amplitude Modulation and Dynamic Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report will focus on two related kinds of effects.
 Those which modulate the amplitude of the signal periodically and those
 which modulate the amplitude of the signal in a way which depends on the
 amplitude of the signal.
 The first category generally results in a very noticeable effect.
 Two examples of this which will be explored in this report are tremelo
 and ring modulation.
 The effect from the second category which will be explored is compression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Tremelo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tremelo is a very straight forward effect.
 Basically the amplitude of the signal is multiplied by a local oscillator
 (LFO) to add a swelling and fading sound to the output of the instrument.
 This effect was commonly used in the surf music of the sixties.
 Tremelo was even built into some guitar amplifiers from that era.
 This was commonly achieved by creating an LFO with a vacuum tube triode
 which would power a small light bulb coupled to a photo-resistor which
 was part of a voltage devision circuit.
 In a less common version of the effect involved connecting the LFO to the
 bias circuit of a tube, either in the preamp or the power amp, in the signal
 path of the amplifier and is known as a bias shifting tremelo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Achieving a tremelo effect digitally is very simple.
 The difference equation is showin in Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:trem1"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y[n]=m[n]x[n]\label{eq:trem1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m[n]=1+αcos(ω{}_{LFO}n)\label{eq:trem2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where m[n] represents the LFO as expressed in Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:trem2"

\end_inset

 with α representing the variable depth of the tremelo.
 The cosine function in Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:trem2"

\end_inset

 is the most common LFO function but triangle, saw-tooth, and sqaure wave
 functions can also be used for different sounds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Ring Modulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tremelo is perceived as a rythmic change in amplitude because the LFO for
 tremelo is set below 10-20 Hz.
 This is because the human ear cannot perceive sounds below about 20Hz.
 By raising the frequency of the LFO beyond this perception cutoff the effect
 begins to be perceived to affect the timbre of the sound rather than the
 amplitude.
 This is called ring modulation and can be achieved using the same difference
 equation Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:trem2"

\end_inset

 and with a slight modifcation to m[n] shown in Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ring1"

\end_inset

.
 Ring modulation is hard to use and uncommon in traditional music.
 It is fairly easy to imagine why.
 Multiplication of two frequencies results in a sum and a difference of
 the two frequencies.
 When the LFO frequency is set there are very few frequencies which, when
 summed and differenced with the LFO, will result in a sound that harmonizes
 with the rest of the piece.
 Ring modulation is sometimes used in experimental or psycodelic music and
 famously used in scoring for sci-fi movies.

\begin_layout Section*
Dynamic Range Compression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compression is a vital effect for making guitar and music in general sound
 good.
 It's often describe as something you don't notice when it's there but you'll
 miss when it's gone.
 Basically compression applies a variable gain to a signal to control the
 dynamic range of the signal.
 If the signal's amplitude is under a given threshold then the gain is 0
 dB, if the amplitude is greater the gain will be less than 0 dB.
 In order to implement a compressor digitally there are two basic processes
 which must occur.
 The gain must be calculated then applied.
 The application of the gain is a simple multiplication process.
 The calculation of the gain is more complicated and there are many ways
 to achieve a working result.
 A simple and common equation for the gain computer is shown in Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:comp"

\end_inset

.
 Where y
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
G

\end_inset

is the gain, T is the threshold, x
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
G
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is input gain, and R is the compression ratio.
 This equation is applied whent the peak amplitude of the input to the gain
 computer is above the threshold as determined by a simple peak detector.
 The gain computer can take either the input or the output signal to the
 effect to create either a feedforward or a feedback configuration respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{G}=T+(x_{G}-T)/R\label{eq:comp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three effects discussed in this report span the spectrum of frequency
 of use.
 Dynamic range compression is ubiquitous in modern music, tremelo is moderately
 common and not too hard to find if you look for it, and ring modulation
 is so rare in music you'd have to find either an experimental musician
 or a scifi film soundtrack to hear it.
 The common thread in these effects is that the real effect is a simple
 multiplication to adjust the amplitude of the signal but how that gain
 is calculated varries.
