\begin_layout Title
Amplitude Modulation and Dynamic Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report will focus on two related kinds of effects.
 Those which modulate the amplitude of the signal periodically and those
 which modulate the amplitude of the signal in a way which depends on the
 amplitude of the signal.
 The first category generally results in a very noticeable effect.
 Two examples of this which will be explored in this report are tremelo
 and ring modulation.
 The effect from the second category which will be explored is compression.

Tremelo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tremelo is a very straight forward effect.
 Basically the amplitude of the signal is multiplied by a local oscillator
 (LFO) to add a swelling and fading sound to the output of the instrument.
 This effect was commonly used in the surf music of the sixties.
 Tremelo was even built into some guitar amplifiers from that era.
 This was commonly achieved by creating an LFO with a vacuum tube triode
 which would power a small light bulb coupled to a photo-resistor which
 was part of a voltage devision circuit.
 In a less common version of the effect involved connecting the LFO to the
 bias circuit of a tube, either in the preamp or the power amp, in the signal
 path of the amplifier and is known as a bias shifting tremelo.

\begin_layout Standard
Achieving a tremelo effect digitally is very simple.
 The difference equation is showin in Eq
