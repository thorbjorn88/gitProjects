\begin_layout Title
The Phase Vocoder 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most audio effects are performed in the time domain.
 This report focuses on a group of audio effects which are performed in
 the frequency domain.
 The phase vocoder is a term used to describe these audio effects.
 The phase vocoder process consists of the following steps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select the first N samples of the input signal which may have arbitrary
 length.
 These N samples are the first frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multiply the fram by a window function of length N.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply a fast fourier transform (FFT) of length M≥N to the windowed signal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform the particular phase vocoder effect to frequency domain signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform an inverse fast fourier transform IFFT on the processed frequency
 domain signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add the M output samples to the output buffer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Hop to the next frame by hop size H which is typically less than N as the
 overlap add method is uses to stitch the frames into one uninterupted signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The windowing, the FFT, IFFT, and overlap add method are not covered in
 detail in this report.
 The focus will be on effects that can be performed using the phase vocoder
 technique.
 In particular robatization, whisperization, time scaling, and pitch shifting
 will be discussed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Robotization and Whisperization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Robotization and whisperization are instructive, if not musical, effects.
 Both these effects are intended to operate on a voice and operate by modifying
 the phase in each bin of the frequency domain signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Robotization gets its name from the monotone robot like sound it results
 in.
 In step 4 of the above procedure the phase in each bin is set to zero while
 the magnitude is left alone.
 Since magnitude is unchanged, the overall shape of the spectrum is also
 unchanged, thus the vocal formants are preserved and the voice is still
 inteligible.
 However, by setting the phase in each bin to zero each frequency component
 will restart from zero phase with each frame rather than having a smooth
 continuous transition between frames.
 The result is a constant pitch related to the hop size between frames where
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{robot}=f_{s}/H$
\end_inset

 where fs is the sample rate and H is the hopsize.
 The quality of the effect is also dependent on the window size.
 For longer windows the resetting of phase is less frequent hence the effect
 is less noticable, and with very short windows the clarity of the output
 is reduced making the voice hard to understand.
 A medium sized window on the order of 256-1024 samples yields the best
 results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While robotization attempts to regulate the pitch of a voice, whisperization
 attempts to remove any sense of pitch at all.
 Whisperization is implemented in almost the same way as robotization but
 the phase is set to a random value between 0 and 2π.
 A random phase is selected for each bin in the frame resulting in the loss
 of any sense of periodicity.
 Again the magnitude is unaffected in order to preserve vocal formants.
 For whiserpization shorter frames on the order of 64-256 samples work best.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because both robotization and whisperization take advantage of artifacts
 of the phase vocoder process the constant overlap-add criteron for choosing
 the hop size in relation to the window size is not important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Time Scaling and Pitch Shifting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful application of the phase vocoder is scaling time or shifitng pitch
 while leaving the other unaffected.
 First we will look at time scaling.
 In order to perform time scaling without affecting pitch the relationship
 Φ=ωt or phase = frequency multiplied with time.
 By allowing phase to be adjust time can be changed while leaving frequency
 uneffected.
 For time scaling the first 3 steps of the phase vocoder are performed as
 usual but steps 5 through 7 are modified to accomodate the change in time.
 A stretching ration R relates the hop size for the analysis steps (1-3)
 and the synthesis steps (5-7) denoted as h

 and h

\end_layout

\end_inset

 respectively such that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{s}=Rh_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 The change in frequency and amplitude for each bin is calculted by the
 following equations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Δ}Φ_{i}(n,k)=\frac{ω_{k}h_{a}+arg(Φ_{d}(n,k))}{h_{a}}ωΔ
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Δ}\text{A}_{i}(n,k)=\frac{A_{i}(n,k)-A_{i}(n-1,k)}{h_{a}}ω\text{Δ}
\]

\end_inset
