	abstract={A simplified homodyne detection scheme for linear FM modulated lidar is presented in which pulse dechirping is performed in the optical domain. This method provides quantum limited detection sensitivity with much less receiver complexity compared to heterodyne detection systems. Another advantage of this approach is the reduced bandwidth requirement for the photodetector. This removes the limit on the chirp bandwidth, and enables the use of more efficient photodiodes with larger detector area. A field trial using a 5-in aperture diameter commercial telescope and a 370-m target range verified the sensitivity estimation and demonstrated the feasibility of this technique.},

	abstract = {The development of an experimental full-waveform LADAR system has been enhanced with the assistance of the LadarSIM system simulation software. The Eyesafe LADAR Test-bed (ELT) was designed as a raster scanning, single-beam, energy-detection LADAR with the capability of digitizing and recording the return pulse waveform at up to 2 GHz for 3D off-line image formation research in the laboratory. To assist in the design phase, the full-waveform LADAR simulation in LadarSIM was used to simulate the expected return waveforms for various system design parameters, target characteristics, and target ranges. Once the design was finalized and the ELT constructed, the measured specifications of the system and experimental data captured from the operational sensor were used to validate the behavior of the system as predicted during the design phase. This paper presents the methodology used, and lessons learned from this "design, build, validate" process. Simulated results from the design phase are presented, and these are compared to simulated results using measured system parameters and operational sensor data. The advantages of this simulation-based process are also presented.},

	abstract = {Ladar systems are an emerging technology with applications in many fields. Consequently, simulations for these systems have become a valuable tool in the improvement of existing systems and the development of new ones. This paper discusses the theory and issues involved in reliably modeling the return waveform of a ladar beam footprint in the Utah State University LadarSIM simulation software. Emphasis is placed on modeling system-level effects that allow an investigation of engineering tradeoffs in preliminary designs, and validation of behaviors in fabricated designs. Efforts have been made to decrease the necessary computation time while still maintaining a usable model. A full waveform simulation is implemented that models optical signals received on detector followed by electronic signals and discriminators commonly encountered in contemporary direct-detection ladar systems. Waveforms are modeled using a novel hexagonal sampling process applied across the ladar beam footprint. Each sample is weighted using a Gaussian spatial profile for a well formed laser footprint. Model fidelity is also improved by using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for target reflectance. Once photons are converted to electrons, waveform processing is used to detect first, last or multiple return pulses. The detection methods discussed in this paper are a threshold detection method, a constant fraction method, and a derivative zero-crossing method. Various detection phenomena, such as range error, walk error, drop outs and false alarms, can be studied using these detection methods.},

	abstract={Frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) radar has the merit of simple structure, small volume, high resolution in space and real-time character. So FMCW radar can detect and orientate the targets on the ground no mater how far they are. However, the measure precision is affected by the FFT method used in the FMCW radar system. In this paper, a new method for increasing the range and velocity measure precision by the Chirp Z-transform in the FMCW radar is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed method can increase both the calculation efficiency and measure precision.},

	abstract={In frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied as a spectrum analyser for beat signal and threshold detection is usually performed on the spectral magnitudes. The picket fence effect of FFT can cause a magnitude loss of the spectral line corresponding to a target, and therefore degrades the detection performance. To analyze this phenomenon in detail, this paper examines the statistical properties of the discrete spectrums of Gaussian noise and beat signal embedded in Gaussian noise, and derives mathematical expressions of false alarm probability and detection probability for FMCW radar. To alleviate the loss caused by the picket fence effect, this paper presents a novel threshold detection method that combines FFT and chirp ztransform (CZT). Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can improve detection probability while reducing false alarm rate, with high operation speed when the number of targets is low.},
