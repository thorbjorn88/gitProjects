\chapter{LadarSIM}

LadarSIM is a robust parameterized tool for simulating lidar systems, which has been
developed at Utah State University's Center for Advanced Imaging Ladar (CAIL) since 2003
\cite{budgeLeishman,neilsenBudge}. LadarSIM was originally developed to simulated pulsed 
time-of-flight lidar systems and has the flexibility to simulate
a wide range of these systems by simulating parameterized lidar transceiver, focal plane 
arrays, and pointing/scanning systems, as well as the interaction of the lidar with a 
simulated 3D scene.
