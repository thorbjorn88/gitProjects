\chapter{CONCLUSION}

Doppler lidar is can contribute useful data in determining altitude, speed, 
and position of a space craft during the landing phase of a mission. Under the
Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project, NASA has 
been developing doppler lidar systems to provide this data \cite{amz12fiber}. It is clear that
Doppler lidar will play a role in forthcoming space exploration missions. 

In selecting or designing a Doppler lidar an engineer must determine
what parameters the system must have in order to meet mission performance 
requirements. This task will be simplified by the development of the proposed
Doppler lidar simulation. This simulation will be added to 
the existing LadarSIM software. The result will be a robust parametric simulation
tool which will be able to simulate the performance of Doppler lidar systems with
arbitrary parameters in arbitrary scenarios.
